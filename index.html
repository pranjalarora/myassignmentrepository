  	this is just <b><u>a timepass section</u></b>.I absolutely don't know what to write.i am just writing some stupid stuff with no meaning. one of the motives is to improve my typing speed as well which literally sucks. I am very bad at typing because i haven't practised it much. okay! now i think its enough for this section . see you in the next section with some other stupid stuff.

  	now, what should i write in the last section. lets spam it with random words. friends, dosti, jhagde, love, first love, happiness, success, family, maa, papa, brother , sister, care, feelings, trust, believing in someone, togethernes, being crazy around someone, loving, caring. I don't know what all did i write but these emotions make us the person we are with a pinch of some counterpart emotions too. 
  	With love, PRANJAL ARORA..
